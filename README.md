# Fraud Detection Analysis and Trend Visualization SQL Project

### This repository contains SQL queries and data for analyzing insurance claim data to detect potential fraud. The project involves cleaning and transforming data, performing statistical analysis, and creating summary tables for visualization in Tableau. 

## Project Overview
The Fraud Detection SQL Project:

Clean and transform insurance claim data.

Calculate statistical metrics such as average claim amounts and total claims by type.

Analyze trends and patterns in claim data to identify potential fraud indicators.

Create a summary table (fraud_summary) in Tableau for easy visualization and analysis.

## Repository Structure
